# N26

ðŸ‘€ Create an Android application that will fetch information about the current Bitcoin market price from an API (suggested resources will be provided below, however you may decide to use other resources) and display the data in a graph of your choice.

### Prerequisites

Before every commit, make sure you run the following commands:

```shell script
./codeAnalysis
```

To check for dependency updates, run the following command:

```shell script
./gradlew dependencyUpdate
```

Refer to this [issue](https://github.com/gradle/gradle/issues/10248), if you get any issues running the lint commands on the terminal :rocket:

## Must-haves:

* Use of Kotlin.
* Good project structure - well structured packages, files and resources that will scale as the project grows.
* Attention to detail - tidy code that is easy to read, consistent formatting, meaningful naming conventions, no IDE warnings, no unused code, etc.
* Architecture design that promotes SOLID principles.
* Dependency injection.
* All code containing logic should be tested (Unit, UI).
* Efficient and responsive layout design.

## Good-to-haves:
* Good UX and well polished UI
* Multi-modular project structure
* Gracefully handled loading/error states.
* Instrumentation tests.
* Handling configuration changes/process death

## Dependencies

All the dependencies (external libraries) are defined in the single place - Gradle `buildSrc` folder. This approach allows to easily manage dependencies and use the same dependency version across all modules.
